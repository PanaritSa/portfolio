### Work Experience
Assistant researcher

- Developed a research plan, designed an experimental setup, and conducted data collection and analysis for the Nam Dok Mai Si Thong mango grading machine project.
- Developed a Python program that utilizes biochemical quantitative data to cluster the maturity level of Nam Dok Mai Si Thong mangoes to label ripeness stages into unripe, ripe, and overripe classes.
- Developed a program in Python for nondestructive detection, accurately classifying the maturity level of Nam Dok Mai Si Thong mangoes with a mean accuracy of 89.6% for unripe, ripe, and overripe classes.
- Showcased the project at the National Research Expo 2019 held at the Centara Grand Hotel and Bangkok Convention Center, Central World, Bangkok.
- Preparation and publish articles “Automatic Classification of the Ripeness Stage of Mango Fruit Using a Machine Learning Approach.” (Cited by 11)
